 Helper is a collection of packages which helps you to work with GoLang standard packages.
 
 Structure of helper packages is the same as structure of standard packages, but theirs names have suffix "h" (helper). Suffix used to avoid ambiguous import.
 
 Functional of helpers is mainly implements things that you expect from standard packages but it is absent. In some cases helpers implement something similar to that in standard package things but in different way or with differences in details. And of course some of functional implemented just because authors think it is helpfull.
 
 Any suggestions and bugs are welcome.
